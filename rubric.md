Reduction to Relation Schema (Based on their ER model):
    Step 1 - Regular Entities:
    Step 2 - Weak Entities (If Any; Otherwise, Assign Maximum Grade for This Point):
    Step 3 - 1:1 Relationships (If Any; Otherwise, Assign Maximum Grade for This Point):
    Step 4 - 1:N Relationships (If Any; Otherwise, Assign Maximum Grade for This Point):
    Step 5 - N:M Relationships (If Any; Otherwise, Assign Maximum Grade for This Point):
    Step 6 - Multi-valued attribue (If Any; Otherwise, Assign Maximum Grade for This Point):
